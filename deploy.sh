# deploy.sh — three-attempt Ansible runner with hybrid retry scope.
#
# Attempt 1: full arbitr_pp_playbook.yaml against every host
# Attempt 2: --limit @retry-file (failed hosts only) if a retry file exists
# Attempt 3: full playbook again (safety net if retry-scoped attempt didn't cover
#            a cross-host dependency)
#
# --forks 52 (up from Ansible default 5) so full sweeps parallelize across the
# PowerPlant fleet without splitting any play into batches.
#
# 52 SPECIFICALLY, raised from 40 on 2026-08-20. Forks below the largest play
# target silently serialise its tail: with 40, the 45-host [windows] plays ran
# in two waves, which cost an extra init_wait_delay (15s) on the second and
# staggered every Windows sweep for no reason.
#
# 52 is the largest group any play targets. Measured, not guessed:
#
#     52  hosts: windows,linux      <- the `common` role, the heaviest sweep
#     47  hosts: splunk-forwarder
#     45  hosts: windows
#     42  hosts: sysmon
#     40  hosts: members
#
# 45 would have covered [windows] and still split the other two.
#
# TRADEOFF: each fork is a separate Python process, so this is a memory
# question rather than a CPU one -- the workers are almost always blocked on
# WinRM/SSH I/O, not computing. 40 forks already ran comfortably on this
# controller; 52 is ~30% more resident memory. If the controller starts
# swapping during a full sweep, drop this rather than assuming the deploy is
# slow for another reason.
#
# If the fleet grows, re-measure rather than incrementing: a play target one
# host above FORKS strands a single host running alone at the end of it.

#                                 three (open/exec/close). Safe on SimSpace
#                                 images (requiretty is off by default).
#                                 No effect on Windows/WinRM.
#   ANSIBLE_GATHERING=smart     — Gather facts once per host per run; skip
#                                 subsequent plays that also gather. Ansible
#                                 remembers what it already gathered.
#   ANSIBLE_CACHE_PLUGIN=jsonfile + fact_cache dir + 24h TTL — persist facts
#                                 across runs, so back-to-back deploys don't
#                                 re-gather on unchanged hosts.

# that the retry loop already handles a VM that is not ready yet. RESTORED
# 2026-08-05 at 180s, because that reasoning did not survive contact with a
# fresh range: the first two attempts of a from-scratch deploy both failed on
# hosts that had not finished booting, and "the retry loop handles it" meant
# paying for two full multi-hour sweeps to discover that. A three-minute wait
# is cheap against a ~5-hour deploy; two wasted passes are not.

# --- Prerequisites the platform is responsible for ---------------------------
# Ported from ss-pp-so 2026-09-01. A blueprint-driven deploy extracts the
# tarball as root and then runs this script unattended, so anything that would
# otherwise be a "now run these commands by hand" instruction has to happen
# here.
#
# /etc/ansible/retry is the one that bites: extracted root-owned, so the
# ansible user cannot write retry files. Every failed run printed "Could not
# create retry file ... Permission denied" and attempt 2 silently lost its
# retry-file scope, degrading to a full sweep -- slower, and it hides which
# hosts actually failed.


# --- Unattended prerequisites -------------------------------------------------
# This deploy is driven by the range BLUEPRINT: the platform spins the images,
# pulls the tarball from GitHub and extracts it, then runs this script. Nobody
# is at a keyboard. Anything that would previously have been a "now run these
# three commands by hand" instruction has to be done here instead.
#
# Two things the extraction leaves wrong:
#   * /etc/ansible/retry — the tarball extracts as root, so the ansible user
#     cannot write retry files. Previously every failed run printed
#     "Could not create retry file ... Permission denied" and attempt 2 lost
#     its retry-file scope, silently degrading to a full sweep.
#   * /home/simspace/.vault_pass — the password file and its value are placed
#     by the platform, but not necessarily with ownership and mode the ansible
#     user can read. 0600 root:root is unreadable to simspace, and every
#     vaulted variable in the repo resolves through it.
#
# `sudo -n` throughout: non-interactive, so a sudo password prompt FAILS
# immediately rather than hanging a headless deploy forever waiting on stdin.
