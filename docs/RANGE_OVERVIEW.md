# Voltgrid Power

### A small electric utility. Fully instrumented. Under attack.

---

Most SIEM training environments treat the network as a backdrop. Logs arrive,
analysts triage them, and nothing an attacker does is constrained by where they
are.

**Voltgrid is built the other way round.** A 77-host power utility with a real
Active Directory forest, a real DMZ, and a genuinely segmented OT enclave
running gas-turbine plant equipment. Three Security Onion sensors watch it from
three different vantage points — and *which sensor sees an event tells you
where the adversary is standing*.

Lateral movement stops being a diagram and becomes something a defender
reconstructs from evidence.

## What defenders get

**A SIEM watching a real network.** Security Onion 2.4, distributed across a
manager, a search node and three sensors. Suricata and Zeek on every mirrored
segment. Elastic Agent on 43 Windows endpoints feeding process and file
telemetry into the same platform.

**A second SIEM, side by side.** A distributed Splunk cluster runs alongside
Security Onion, with a universal forwarder on every managed host feeding it in
parallel — so a cohort can be trained and assessed on either platform over the
very same estate, and a gap in one is not a gap in the other.

**One place to look.** Network evidence, endpoint telemetry, web and proxy
access logs, and firewall and router syslog all land in the same platform,
parsed into their own datasets — so correlating a proxy request with the
process that made it and the firewall rule that allowed it is one investigation,
not three.

**Six FLARE-imaged analyst positions plus a forensics bench** — SIFT and REMnux
on the same segment, tooling ready — deliberately excluded from the
emulated-user population, so an analyst's own activity never contaminates the
host they investigate from.

**A network that is already busy.** 32 emulated users log in, browse, open
documents and move files continuously. Detections have to survive contact with
a network that is not quiet — because production never is.

**IT and OT, properly separated.** Corporate runs OSPF; the plant sits behind a
firewall boundary reachable only by static route, with its own domain
controller so routine OT identity traffic never crosses. An intrusion that
reaches the control station is a different event, on a different sensor, than
one that stops in the DMZ.

## What event coordinators get

**Two attack paths, usable together.** A Kali workstation for manual red team
operations, and scripted attack emulation targeting six high-value hosts
spanning both sides of the firewall boundary. Start automated, continue by
hand; the defender's view does not change shape.

**Tunable visibility.** Endpoint coverage is an inventory group, not a
hard-coded list. Removing the plant control station from Sysmon coverage is a
one-line change that makes the OT enclave meaningfully harder to investigate —
and models how conservative utilities actually instrument process equipment.

**Repeatable builds.** The entire range is Ansible from a pinned tarball,
verified by two scripts that assert outcomes rather than exit codes. Stand it
up, run the exercise, rebuild it clean.

## The terrain

| | |
|---|---|
| **Scale** | 77 hosts across 13 host-bearing segments, plus 7 point-to-point transit links |
| **Identity** | `voltgrid.com` — three domain controllers, 39 domain members, 32 emulated users |
| **Corporate** | Services, Business Processing, Engineering, Legal, InfoSec |
| **Perimeter** | DMZ with public web and DNS; simulated Internet beyond |
| **OT enclave** | Control network, gas turbine, turbine simulation and OT services — PLC, historian, vibration sensor, engineering workstation |
| **Security** | Security Onion grid and a distributed Splunk cluster, plus six analyst workstations |
| **Routing** | OSPF core, eBGP at the ISP edge, static across the OT boundary |

## Training value

| Skill | How the range exercises it |
|---|---|
| Network forensics | Full packet visibility on three segments via layer-2 mirrors — Zeek connection, DNS, HTTP and file logs |
| Endpoint investigation | Sysmon and Elastic Agent process, file and network telemetry across 43 hosts |
| Lateral movement detection | Segment-aware sensor placement makes east-west movement observable as a change in *which* sensor carries the traffic |
| IT/OT boundary defence | A real firewall boundary with its own DC — crossing it is detectable, and the plant side gives deliberately reduced visibility |
| Alert triage under load | Continuous emulated user activity means signal must be separated from genuine background noise |
| Threat hunting | Dedicated analyst positions with the full Security Onion toolset and no synthetic activity of their own |
| Multi-SIEM operations | The same activity is visible in both Security Onion and Splunk, so analysts pivot between platforms over identical data |

## Deployment

Ansible from a pinned, versioned tarball. Two to three hours from a clean
blueprint to a verified range, unattended. Its major install artifacts —
Security Onion, Splunk and Malcolm, their container images, and the Ansible
collections — come from the platform's own package repository rather than the public
internet, so a build is deterministic and does not depend on upstream
availability. Verification asserts what actually matters — that sensors are
receiving packets, that Zeek is producing connection records, that every
endpoint is enrolled — not merely that the playbook exited zero.
